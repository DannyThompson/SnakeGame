SNAKE by Daniel Thompson

This was done as a project in my Data Structures course at Sonoma State University

It is a simple command-line-run version of the game Snake/Worm.

Code is thoroughly commented to explain some of the functions.

To move, you can use the VIM hjkl movement, or standard WASD movement.


The "main" is recycled from the original main file, which was named "screep.cpp",
so the startup and terminate functions were provided to us.

Also: getChar.cpp/.hpp was provided to us and was ONLY altered to make the snake move slightly faster initially.

Type "make" to compile.

After compiling, type "make run" to run.
